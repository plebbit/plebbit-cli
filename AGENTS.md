# AGENTS.md

## Purpose

This file provides curated, minimal guidance for AI agents working in this repo.
Rules are prioritized (MUST > SHOULD) so agents know what to enforce vs. what to prefer.
Detailed workflows live in playbooks loaded on demand — not inlined here.

## Surprise Handling

If something behaves unexpectedly (a test fails for unclear reasons, a build breaks in a surprising way, a dependency does something unusual):

1. **Stop** — do not retry in a loop or force your way through.
2. **Investigate** — read error output, check recent commits, look at related code.
3. **Document** — if you discover a non-obvious gotcha, tell the user so it can be captured.

## Project Overview

**bitsocial-cli** is an oclif-based CLI + daemon for the BitSocial protocol (built on top of pkc-js). It manages communities, challenges, IPFS nodes, and web UIs from the command line.

## Instruction Priority

| Level  | Meaning                                           |
| ------ | ------------------------------------------------- |
| **MUST**   | Non-negotiable. Breaking these causes failures or bad releases. |
| **SHOULD** | Strong default. Override only with good reason.   |

## Task Router

Quick lookup — find your situation, follow the required actions:

| Situation                     | Do this                                                       |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| First time / fresh clone      | `nvm use` → `npm ci` → `npm run build`                       |
| Changed any `.ts` file        | `npm run build && npm run build:test`                         |
| Running tests                 | `npm run test:cli`                                            |
| Added feature or fixed bug    | Write a test → build → run tests                             |
| Installing a dependency       | `nvm use` first, then `npm install ...`                       |
| Routine node/community config | Perform the requested live operation → verify → summarize; no GitHub issue unless explicitly requested |
| Before committing             | Build passes, all tests pass                                  |

## Stack

| Layer       | Technology                          |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Runtime     | Node 22 (`nvm use` reads `.nvmrc`)  |
| Language    | TypeScript (ESM, `"type": "module"`)  |
| CLI framework | oclif                             |
| Test runner | Vitest                              |
| Package mgr | **npm** (not yarn, not pnpm)        |
| Build       | `tsc` with configs in `config/`     |

## Docs Lookup

Topic docs live flat under `docs/`; [docs/README.md](docs/README.md) is the index. Before touching an area, read its doc:

| Touching                                                                 | Read                                       |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------ |
| `src/cli/commands/challenge/`, `src/challenge-packages/`                 | [docs/challenges.md](docs/challenges.md)   |
| `src/cli/commands/page-sort/`, `src/page-sort-packages/`                 | [docs/page-sorts.md](docs/page-sorts.md)   |
| `src/common-utils/package-registry.ts`, package reload endpoints in `src/webui/daemon-server.ts` | both of the above |
| `settings.challenges` / `settings.pages` examples in `src/cli/commands/community/edit.ts` | the matching doc above |

When a change alters behavior a doc describes (commands, flags, paths, endpoints, output), update the doc in the same PR.

## GitHub Issues

When the user gives a prompt to implement a feature or bug fix in this repository's codebase:

1. **MUST** create a GitHub issue for the feature before starting work (`gh issue create`).
2. **MUST** keep the issue updated with the current plan and progress as work proceeds.
3. **MUST** put `Closes #N` in the PR body so the issue auto-closes when the PR merges. Closing keywords go in the PR body only, never in commit messages.
4. **MUST** ask the user before closing an issue manually (`gh issue close`); auto-close via PR merge needs no ask.

Routine live operations are not repository feature work:

- **MUST NOT** create GitHub issues for routine live-node operations, community/board configuration changes, data updates, support tasks, or private infrastructure administration unless the user explicitly asks for one.
- **MUST** ask before creating any public GitHub artifact when a task could be interpreted as either repository work or live operations.
- **MUST NOT** include private infrastructure details, secrets, API keys, or user-specific operational data in GitHub issues, comments, PRs, or commit messages.

## AI Context Tools

For very large non-source artifacts such as CI logs, debug traces, generated JSON, or massive command output, agents may optionally use `chopratejas/headroom` or a similar local compression tool as a navigation aid, but must verify conclusions against the original uncompressed artifact before editing code or making final claims.

## Core MUST Rules

### Environment Setup

- **MUST** run `nvm use` before any npm command (`npm ci`, `npm install`, `npm run`, etc.).
- **MUST** use **npm**, never yarn or pnpm.

### Build & Test

- **MUST** verify build passes after any code change: `npm run build && npm run build:test`.
- **MUST** run tests with `npm run test:cli` (not `vitest` directly — the script downloads web UIs first).
- **MUST** ensure all tests pass before committing.

### Code Organization

- **MUST** add a test when you add a feature or fix a bug.

### Docs

- **MUST** add an entry to `docs/README.md` when adding a topic doc (any markdown file under `docs/` other than `docs/README.md` itself and the generated `docs/CHANGELOG.md`), and a row to the Docs Lookup table above if the doc maps to source paths.

## Core SHOULD Rules

- **SHOULD** keep changes focused — avoid unrelated refactors in the same commit.
- **SHOULD** prefer editing existing files over creating new ones.
- **SHOULD** check `config/` for tsconfig and vitest settings before assuming defaults.

## Common Commands

```bash
nvm use                              # switch to project's Node version
npm ci                               # clean install dependencies
npm run build                        # compile TypeScript → dist/
npm run build:test                   # compile test TypeScript
npm run build && npm run build:test  # full build check
npm run test:cli                     # run all tests (downloads web UIs first)
npm run build:watch                  # watch mode for main build
npm run build:test:watch             # watch mode for test build
```

## Playbooks (Load On Demand)

_No playbooks yet. As recurring workflows emerge (e.g., release process, adding a new command, upgrading pkc-js), create them as separate files and reference them here._

<!-- Example future entry:
- [Adding a new CLI command](playbooks/new-command.md)
- [Upgrading pkc-js](playbooks/upgrade-pkc-js.md)
